# Social Meditation Definitions
This repository contains social meditation instructions in machine-readable formats. They are intended to be used as a canconical definition of social meditation instructions that can be used by downstream tools and technologies, such as [gpt-meditation](https://github.com/urbanski/gpt-meditation).

## Background
In December 2022 [I started experimenting with social meditation instructions in ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/WillUrbanski/status/1604270082607042561). After iterating on prompts, I was able to get ChatGPT to participate in simple social meditation practices. While developing the prompts, I realized that the social meditation instructions were difficult to interact with from Python and required a lot of manual grokking to get into a machine readable format. This repository is an attempt to mitigate that.

This work is inspired and derived from the Social Meditation instructions that have been created and documented by Kenneth Folk and Vince Fakhoury Horn, et al. You can read more about [Social Meditation at www.socialmeditation.guide.](https://www.socialmeditation.guide)
